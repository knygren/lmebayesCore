# glmbayesCore (development version)

* **Per-group `dGamma_list()` prior now uses the §3.3.4 marginal rate:**
  **`dGamma_list.lmebayes_prior_setup()`** feeds each group's `dGamma()` the
  Chapter A12 **§3.3.4** marginal ING rate (`beta` integrated out) instead of
  the **§3.3.5** fixed-`beta` `rate_gamma`. This is the theoretically correct
  choice for the Block~1 ING sampler, which draws `sigma2_j` from the
  marginal law and then `b_j | sigma2_j` (`beta` is never held fixed at a
  point estimate during that draw). `rate_gamma` remains on
  `ing_prior_measurement_group` for diagnostic comparison only (printed by
  a dev-only table in **`Prior_Setup_lmebayes()`** whenever `dispformula`
  requests per-group dispersion); nothing downstream consumes it. Truncation
  bounds (`disp_lower`/`disp_upper`, `blup_infl`, `R_lo`/`R_hi`) are
  unaffected -- they were already mean-matched at `sigma2_hat`, which is now
  also the new rate's exact prior mean (previously it was not, for the
  most BLUP-inflated groups). See `inst/DGAMMA_LIST_MARGINAL_AND_BOUNDS.md`
  Parts I-II.

* **GLMM router (`.lmebayes_run_glmm_engine()`):** non-Gaussian **`rglmerb()`**
  dispatches through **`REG_ROUTE_TABLE`** to **`rGLMM_reg_known_vcov()`** or
  **`rGLMM_reg_estimated_vcov()`** (replacing a direct **`rGLMM_reg()`** call).
  LMM routing (**`.lmebayes_run_lmm_engine()`**) uses the same table for four
  Gaussian routes.

* **GLMM engines split (`rGLMM_reg.R`):** monolithic **`rGLMM()`** replaced by
  **`rGLMM_reg_known_vcov()`**, **`rGLMM_reg_estimated_vcov()`**, and dispatcher
  **`rGLMM_reg()`** (shared help **`?rGLMM_reg`**). Non-Gaussian models always
  run a pilot stage (unless **`n_pilot = 0L`**); the two routes differ in
  eigenvalue-bound complexity (fixed **`dNormal`** τ² vs ING **`disp_lower`**
  conservatism), not in whether a pilot runs.

* **LMM engines merged (`rLMM_reg.R`):** **`rLMMNormal_reg.R`** and
  **`rLMMIngNormal_reg.R`** are one module with shared help **`?rLMM_reg`**
  (aliases for six exports). There is no standalone **`rLMM()`** export —
  matrix Gaussian LMMs use **`rLMMNormal_reg_*`** / **`rLMMindepNormalGamma_reg_*`**
  routes; formula GLMMs use **`rGLMM_reg`** via **`rglmerb()`**.

* **`rlmerb()` four-route routing:** **`.lmebayes_run_lmm_engine()`** dispatches
  to **`rLMMNormal_reg_known_vcov()`**, **`rLMMNormal_reg_estimated_vcov()`**,
  **`rLMMindepNormalGamma_reg_known_vcov()`**, or
  **`rLMMindepNormalGamma_reg_estimated_vcov()`** from fixed vs ING Block~2 and
  fixed vs dGamma σ². Legacy **`rLMMindepNormalGamma_reg()`** (outer σ² loop)
  remains exported but is not the default **`rlmerb()`** path.

* **ICM at fixed variance components:** **`lmerb_posterior_mean()`** /
  **`glmerb_posterior_mode()`** iterate Block~1 / Block~2 hyperparameters at
  **fixed** \(\tau^2_k\) and \(\sigma^2\) plug-ins
  (**`.two_block_tau2_plug_in_from_pfamily()`**, `rate/(shape−1)`). Removed
  joint posterior-mode τ² iteration (**`two_block_joint_posterior_mode()`** stack).

* **Scale-invariant ICM stopping rule:** **`glmerb_posterior_mode()`** now
  measures the Block~2 `delta` used for the `tol`/`converged` check as a
  per-component Mahalanobis distance \(\sqrt{(\gamma_k^{new}-\gamma_k)^\top
  P_{\gamma_k}^{\mathrm{post}} (\gamma_k^{new}-\gamma_k)}\) in each RE
  component's own posterior-precision metric, maximized over components
  \(k\) — not the previous raw \(\ell_\infty\) change in `fixef`. The old
  criterion depended on the arbitrary units of each hyper-covariate, so
  rescaling or whitening an `X_hyper[[k]]` column changed convergence
  behavior even though the fitted model and posterior were unchanged; the
  new one does not. The per-block posterior precision (`post_P_list`) is now
  also hoisted out of the ICM loop since it does not depend on the iteration
  state. (Superseded for **`lmerb_posterior_mean()`** by the exact closed-form
  solve below, which has no stopping rule at all.)

* **`lmerb_posterior_mean()` is now an exact closed-form solve, not ICM:**
  the Gaussian Block~1/Block~2 target is exactly jointly Gaussian, and
  Block~1's conditional mean per group is affine in the shared hyperparameter
  vector \(\gamma\) with no direct coupling between groups. Substituting that
  affine relationship into the Block~2 update eliminates every group's random
  effect algebraically (a Schur-complement/Henderson-mixed-model-equations
  elimination), leaving one small linear system in \(\gamma\) alone (dimension
  = total hyperparameter count, independent of the number of groups \(J\)).
  Solving it once gives the exact joint mean — no alternating iteration,
  `tol`, `maxit`, or non-convergence warning is possible for this model, and
  it costs \(O(J)\) (never a \(J \times J\) or \(J p_{re}\)-dimensional
  matrix), so it scales to large numbers of groups. `tol`/`maxit` remain
  accepted (for interface parity with **`glmerb_posterior_mode()`**, which is
  unchanged and still iterates for non-Gaussian families) but are unused;
  the return always has `converged = TRUE`, `iterations = 1L`, `delta = 0`.
  This also restores the exact `D0 = 0` (start at the true posterior mean)
  assumption that **`two_block_tv_bound()`**/**`two_block_l_for_tv()`**'s
  sweep-count guarantee relies on, which a non-converged ICM start could
  silently violate.

* **`two_block_l_for_tv()` no longer errors when the search exceeds `l_max`:**
  it now issues a single `warning()` (when `warn = TRUE`) and returns a
  practical uncertified fallback capped at **200 inner sweeps**
  (`l <= 199`), not `l_max = 1e6`.  The old `l_max` return caused integer
  overflow in pilot cost optimization (`n_pilot * m_convergence_pilot`)
  and invalid `n_pilot` values.  Internal repeated calls (pilot cost
  search) pass `warn = FALSE` to avoid warning spam.  Mode-gap pilot sweep
  calibration and inner-sweep counts are likewise capped at 200 via
  `.two_block_cap_inner_sweeps()` / `.two_block_m_pilot_from_gap()`.
  `l_max`/`m_min` calibration is inherently a best-effort setup step
  (choosing a burn-in sweep count), not part of the returned draws, so a
  near-degenerate `rate$lambda_star` (close to 1) should not abort the
  whole **`lmerb()`**/**`rlmerb()`**/**`glmerb()`**/**`rglmerb()`**
  call; all internal calibration call sites inherit this automatically.

* **`dGamma_list()` gains `disp_center = c("sigma2_hat", "dispersion2")`:**
  the default (`"sigma2_hat"`) reproduces the existing per-group truncation
  window unchanged (mean-matched at `sigma2_hat_j`, upper tail widened by
  `disp_upper_anchor`). The new opt-in `"dispersion2"` mean-matches both
  bounds symmetrically at an `EnvelopeCentering()`-style dispersion estimate
  that integrates over the random effect's own posterior uncertainty
  (new `n_rss_iter` argument, default `10L`, controls its fixed-point
  iteration count) instead of BLUP-inflating `sigma2_hat_j`; `disp_upper_anchor`
  is ignored in this mode. Tends to produce narrower, better-centered upper
  tails for groups with large BLUP/OLS RSS inflation. New helper
  **`.lmebayes_group_dispersion2_envelope_centering()`**
  (`R/mixed_rmerb_helpers.R`); `window_diagnostics` gains a `dispersion2`
  column. See `inst/DGAMMA_LIST_MARGINAL_AND_BOUNDS.md` Part III.

* **Rate helper rename:** **`two_block_rate_v2()`** removed; use
  **`two_block_rate_from_pfamily_list()`** (`R/two_block_ergodicity.R`)
  for the `pfamily_list` adapter around **`two_block_rate()`**.

* **Two-block ergodicity consolidation:** rate, TV-bound, and mode-weight
  helpers merged into **`R/two_block_ergodicity.R`**. **`two_block_mode_weights()`**
  is no longer exported (still used internally by **`rGLMM()`** for non-Gaussian
  rate calibration).

* **C++ R callbacks via registered namespace:** envelope and simulation C++
  now resolve **`EnvelopeOpt()`**, **`EnvelopeSort()`**, **`glmbfamfunc()`**,
  **`rNormal_reg.wfit()`**, and **`rgamma_ct()`** from the **`glmbayesCore`**
  namespace (`R_interface.h` / `GLMBAYES_R_NS`), so downstream packages
  (e.g. **lmebayes**) no longer need to re-export them for search-path lookup.

* **LMM engine split:** **`rLMMNormal_reg()`** samples with fixed observation
  dispersion (\code{prior_list = list(dispersion = sigma2)}); **`P`** is a
  separate argument. **`rLMMindepNormalGamma_reg()`** implements an outer
  two-block Gibbs sampler (dispersion via **`rGamma_reg()`**, fixed effects and
  random effects via full **`rLMMNormal_reg()`** runs).

* **`rGLMM()` pilot defaults:** non-Gaussian models now run pilot + main by
  default. New argument **`gap_tol`** (default `0.0196`) derives **`n_pilot`**
  when **`n_pilot = NULL`**; **`n_pilot = 0L`** or **`gap_tol = NULL`** skips
  the pilot. Gaussian models never run a pilot. **`tv_tol`** now defaults to
  **`0.01`**. Helper **`.two_block_resolve_n_pilot()`** centralises the policy.

* **Matrix LMM / GLMM ICM:** when `start = NULL` (default), **`rLMM_reg`**
  routes and **`rGLMM()`** compute Block~2 starts via
  **`lmerb_posterior_mean()`** / **`glmerb_posterior_mode()`** at **fixed**
  variance-component plug-ins, using **`.two_block_measurement_prior_list()`**
  (and **`.two_block_tau2_plug_in_from_pfamily()`** for τ²). Outputs include
  **`ranef.mode`** and **`icm_info`**. Non-Gaussian **`rGLMM()`** still requires
  **`b_start`** when **`start`** is user-supplied.

* **Matrix LMM replicate chains:** Gaussian LMM sampling is exported as six
  **`rLMM_reg`** engines (four direct **`rlmerb()`** routes plus two
  dispatchers). Formula-level fitting remains in **lmebayes**
  (`rlmerb()` / `lmerb()`).

* **Restored `rGLMM()`:** matrix-level GLMM replicate-chain orchestration
  (TV calibration, pilot chi-squared, post-pilot eigenvalue upper bound,
  main-stage sampling via **`rGLMM_sweep`**) is exported again
  as **`rGLMM()`**. Replaces the earlier C++-staged implementation; returns
  the `fixef.*` namespace. Formula-level fitting remains in **lmebayes**
  (`rglmerb()` / `glmerb()`).

* **Candidate counts surfaced by the two-block v2 sampler:**
  **`two_block_rNormal_reg_v2()`** now returns `iters_fixef_draws`, an
  `n x p_re` matrix of the total number of Block 2 candidates generated per
  stored draw, summed over the `m_convergence` inner sweeps.
  `dIndependent_Normal_Gamma` components count the envelope accept-reject
  candidates until acceptance (the `iters_out` already produced by
  `rIndepNormalGammaReg`, previously discarded by the Gibbs loop); `dNormal`
  components count exactly one conjugate draw per sweep, so their columns
  equal `m_convergence`.  Dividing by `m_convergence` gives the average
  number of candidates per accepted draw (roughly the reciprocal envelope
  acceptance rate), matching the `iters` semantics of `rglmb`-style
  samplers.  Reading the counts consumes no RNG, so draws are
  bitwise-identical to the previous version under the same seed.

* **Prior-vs-data guard for `dIndependent_Normal_Gamma` sampling:**
  **`rindepNormalGamma_reg()`** now rejects calls where the Gamma (precision)
  part of the prior carries more effective prior observations than the data
  supply: inverting the `Prior_Setup()` calibration
  `shape = (n_prior + 1 + p)/2`, sampling requires
  `n_prior <= n_w = sum(weights)` (equivalently a prior weight
  `pwt <= 0.5`). Rationale: the dispersion envelope caps its log-tilt at
  `n_w/2` - the *data* contribution to the posterior Gamma shape (Remark
  4.1.3 of the ING vignette) - a strengthening of the validity condition
  `lm_log2 < shape2` that presumes a likelihood-dominated regime.
  Prior-dominated calls could previously bind that cap on every envelope
  build (console `UB3A mean slope` warnings) and silently degrade the
  envelope. Note that `n_prior` here is the effective sample size of the
  Gamma component specifically; under the `Prior_Setup()` calibration the
  Gamma and coefficient parts share a common `n_prior`, so the two are not
  fully independent.

* **Same guard in the two-block v2 sampler:**
  **`two_block_rNormal_reg_v2()`** enforces `n_prior <= J` per
  `dIndependent_Normal_Gamma` component (with `J = length(group_levels)`,
  the Block 2 hyper-regression observation count and `q_k = length(mu)`:
  `2*shape - 1 - q_k <= J`, i.e. `pwt_disp <= 0.5`).  Calibration-only
  paths (`two_block_rate_v2()`) are exempt since they use the `disp_lower`
  plug-in without sampling.

* **`pfamily_list()` generic:** New S3 generic for building a named list of
  pfamily objects from a prior-specification container.  Downstream
  packages provide methods (e.g. `lmebayes` for `Prior_Setup_lmebayes()`
  objects, mapping each random-effect component to `dNormal()` or
  `dIndependent_Normal_Gamma()`).

* **Convergence rate for the two-block sampler:** New **`two_block_rate()`**
  computes the eigenvalues of
  `A = P11^{-1/2} P12 P22^{-1} P21 P11^{-1/2}` (Nygren 2020, Remark 8) for
  the joint Gaussian posterior targeted by **`two_block_rNormal_reg()`**,
  without ever forming the `J*p_re x J*p_re` Block 1 precision: the cross
  moment is accumulated per group with `p_re x p_re` solves followed by a
  single `q x q` symmetric eigendecomposition. The maximal eigenvalue
  `lambda*` is the geometric TV contraction rate of the sampler;
  `m_for_tol(tol)` returns the implied number of inner Gibbs sweeps. For
  non-Gaussian families explicit IRLS-style `weights` give a local-Gaussian
  heuristic. Validated against a dense brute-force construction of the joint
  precision and against the observed contraction of the ICM mean recursion
  (`lmerb_posterior_mean()`), which contracts at exactly `lambda*`.

* **Likelihood precision at the posterior mode:** New
  **`two_block_mode_weights()`** evaluates per-observation likelihood
  precisions (IRLS/Fisher weights) at a supplied random-effects value -
  typically the joint posterior mode from `glmerb_posterior_mode()` - and
  assembles the per-group likelihood precision blocks `Z_j' W_j Z_j`.
  Weights are computed generically from the family object
  (`w_i = wt_i mu'(eta_i)^2 / (V(mu_i) phi)`): exact observed Hessian for
  canonical links (gaussian, poisson-log, binomial-logit), expected (Fisher)
  information otherwise - including correct probit/cloglog/Gamma-log weights
  where `glmbfamfunc()$f7` carries copy-pasted logistic weights.  The
  `weights` component feeds `two_block_rate(weights = )` directly, providing
  the local-Gaussian heuristic input for extending the TV-rate analysis to
  non-Gaussian `glmerb` models.  Validated against `f7` on its correct
  branches and against the exact Gaussian rate path.

* **Explicit TV convergence bounds:** New **`two_block_tv_bound()`**
  evaluates the total-variation bound between the `l`-step kernel and the
  target (Nygren 2020) from the `two_block_rate()` spectrum, two ways:
  `method = "theorem3"` computes the exact per-eigendirection terms
  `d_i^(l)` using the closed form `erf_n(x) = pchisq(2 x^2, n)` with
  `r_i^(l) = (1 - a_{i-1}^{2l})/(1 - a_i^{2l})`; `method = "corollary1"`
  evaluates the looser geometric envelope with explicit constants. With the
  chain started at the exact posterior mean (as `lmerb` does), the mean term
  vanishes identically (`D0 = 0` default) and only the variance-convergence
  sum remains, which decays like `lambda*^{2l}` - twice the exponent of the
  crude `(lambda*)^m` proxy. **`two_block_l_for_tv()`** inverts the bound to
  give the number of inner Gibbs sweeps required for a target tolerance, and
  `print.two_block_rate()` now tabulates proxy vs Theorem 3 vs Corollary 1
  sweeps. On the lmerb big_word_club example (`lambda* = 0.839`): TV <= 1e-3
  needs 16 sweeps (Theorem 3) / 23 (Corollary 1) vs 40 for the proxy.

* **Two-block Gibbs loop in C++:** The main loop of
  **`two_block_rNormal_reg()`** (Block 1 random-effects update, Block 2
  hyperparameter update, `m_convergence` inner steps, replicate sampling) now
  runs entirely in C++ (`two_block_rNormal_reg_cpp_export` in
  `src/twoBlockGibbs.cpp`), eliminating per-iteration R/C++ round trips. This
  is a port-only change: the R wrapper still performs input validation,
  `glmbfamfunc()` resolution, and output assembly, and the C++ driver calls
  the same per-block samplers (`rNormalGLM` envelope sampler, `rNormalReg`)
  in the same order as the previous R loop. Draws are statistically
  equivalent but not bit-reproducible against the old R loop because the C++
  rejection sampler uses its own RNG stream (compare averages over many
  draws, not individual draws).

* **Faster GLM block sampling:** **`block_rNormalGLM()`** now performs block
  partitioning and prior payload assembly in C++
  (`block_rNormalGLM_cpp_export`), removing per-call R overhead in block
  Gibbs loops (e.g. Block 1 of the **lmebayes** two-block sampler). The
  sampling algorithm itself is unchanged: each block still calls the existing
  `rNormalGLM()` envelope sampler serially. Posterior modes are numerically
  identical to the previous R-prep path; individual draws follow the same
  distribution but are not bit-reproducible against the old path (compare
  means over longer runs). Present-but-`NULL` prior elements (e.g.
  `dispersion = NULL`) are treated as absent, matching R `is.null()`
  semantics.

# glmbayes 0.9.6

## Highlights

* **Multi-response `lmb()`:** **`lmb()`** now handles both univariate and
  multivariate responses with a single unified interface, mirroring the behaviour
  of R's **`lm()`**. When the response has a single column the result is an
  **`lmb`** object (unchanged from prior releases). When the formula specifies
  multiple response columns (e.g. `cbind(y1, y2) ~ x`), **`lmb()`** fits a
  separate Bayesian linear model per response column and returns a named list
  with class **`mlmb`**. For the multi-response case, **`pfamily`** must be a
  list of **`pfamily`** objects with exactly one entry per response column;
  passing a single **`pfamily`** object is an error. Summary, print, and
  coefficient methods for **`mlmb`** objects are included.

* **Conjugate GLM priors (Poisson, binomial, Gamma):** New closed-form IID
  sampling paths for intercept-only models with identity links. **`dBeta()`**
  with **`rBeta_reg()`** supports Beta–Binomial(identity) conjugate updates;
  **`dGamma(Inv_Dispersion = FALSE)`** with **`rGamma_Conjugate_reg()`**
  supports Gamma–Poisson(identity) and Gamma–Gamma(identity) rate priors.
  **`Prior_Setup()`** can calibrate conjugate hyperparameters for these
  families (weighted Poisson rate and binomial probability defaults). See
  **`?dBeta`**, **`?dGamma`**, and the Chapter 02 / Chapter 07–11 vignettes.

* **Vignette structure:** Reworked **Chapter 00** as a roadmap across five
  main parts plus technical appendices. **Chapter 02** is now a conceptual
  introduction to single-parameter conjugacy; worked examples move to
  **Chapter 02-S01** through **Chapter 02-S05** (Beta–Binomial, Normal–Normal,
  Gamma–Poisson, exposure-weighted Poisson, and related topics). A **Companion
  textbooks** section in Chapter 00 indexes optional Bayes Rules! and `LearnBayes`
  appendices tied to the main GLM chapters.

* **`opencltools` import:** Core host/runtime OpenCL discovery and diagnostics
  (`detect_*`, PATH helpers, environment checks) now live in the **`opencltools`**
  package (`Imports`, >= 0.8.0). **glmbayes** keeps package-specific entry
  points (`glmbayesCore_has_opencl()`, `diagnose_glmbayes()`) that report compile-time
  OpenCL status for this build while delegating shared GPU/runtime checks—reducing
  duplicated maintenance in **glmbayes**.

* **Bayes Rules! companion examples:** Optional vignette appendices reproduce
  book datasets and published posterior summaries using **`lmb()`**, **`glmb()`**,
  **`Prior_Setup()`**, and **`dNormal()`** (suggested package **`bayesrules`** for
  data only). Coverage includes **`bikes`** (Ch. 03), **`weather_perth`** (Ch. 08–09),
  **`equality_index`** (Ch. 10), Gamma–Poisson conjugacy (Ch. 02-S04), and a
  scope note for Gamma regression (Ch. 11). Comparison tables use **printed book
  values**, not live **`rstanarm`** fits. See **Chapter 00** § Companion textbooks.

* **`LearnBayes` examples:** **Chapter 02-S04**, Appendix A, maps the
  **`hearttransplants`** example from Albert (2009) / `LearnBayes` (exposure-weighted
  Gamma–Poisson conjugacy) to **`glmb()`** with analytic Albert posteriors for
  verification (suggested package **`LearnBayes`**).

## Other changes

* Expanded **testthat** coverage for **`dBeta()`** / binomial(identity) conjugate
  paths and related **`glmb()`** integration.

# glmbayes 0.9.5

* **Tests / CRAN:** All **OpenCL**-specific **testthat** blocks now call
  **`skip_on_cran()`** (in addition to **`skip_if_no_opencl()`**), consistent
  with existing Boston/Cleveland OpenCL tests. OpenCL coverage remains for local
  checks and source builds with OpenCL; CRAN checks avoid parallel/GPU-heavy
  tests that could trigger **CPU time vs elapsed time** NOTES.

# glmbayes 0.9.4

* **Vignettes:** A vignette that previously used the `notangle` engine now
  uses the standard R Markdown vignette machinery (`knitr` /
  `rmarkdown::html_vignette`), so builds align with CRAN expectations and
  vignette index ordering should be consistent with the rest of the package.

* **OpenCL sources (`inst/cl`):** Removed unused or superseded material,
  consolidated kernels and library fragments, and aligned `.cl` layout and
  dependency tagging with the conventions used in 'openclport' and
  'nmathopencl' (prelude, shims, `nmath/` stems, family kernels under
  `src/`). See `inst/cl/README.md` for how the assembled program is stitched.

* **OpenCL program assembly:** Reworked loading so the full OpenCL program is
  built from explicit fragments (global header, `nmath` closure, family/link
  kernels) rather than ad hoc concatenation—clearer ownership of what enters
  GPU compilation and easier parity with CPU paths.

* **Tests:** Added and expanded **testthat** coverage aimed at OpenCL code
  paths (including binomial examples that exercise GPU envelope evaluation),
  complementing existing Cleveland-style checks.

* **Bug fix — binomial OpenCL:** Binomial `f2_f3` OpenCL kernels now evaluate
  the data log-likelihood with the same **proportion × trial-count**
  semantics as **`dbinom_glmb`** on the CPU (`round` successes and trials,
  clamped probability). This fixes envelope / PLSD failures for aggregated
  binomial data (e.g. `cbind(successes, failures)` / `MASS::menarche`) where
  the previous kernels treated **`y`** like a raw success count.

# glmbayes 0.9.3

* Published on CRAN.
* Version bump in response to CRAN resubmission feedback.

# glmbayes 0.9.2

* Version bump in preparation for resubmission incorporating CRAN review feedback.

# glmbayes 0.9.1

* Wrapped OpenCL-dependent examples in `\donttest{}` for CRAN compliance.
* Reduced iteration counts in rlmb Gibbs sampler example to stay within
  CRAN example time limits on slower check machines.

# glmbayes 0.9.0

First CRAN submission. This release is a stable pre-release with a
near-complete feature set relative to earlier development builds.

## Highlights

### Bayesian Generalized Linear (glmb) and Linear (lmb) modeling functions:

  `glmb()` is a Bayesian analog for the classical `glm()` function while
  `lmb()` covers Gaussian models. Calls largely mirror those for the 
  classical functions but leverage pfamilies for prior specifications.
  Method functions largely mirror those for the classical functions. 
  Samples generated by the functions are largely iid samples 
  (no MCMC convergence dignostics are needed).

### Implemented Likelihood families/ link functions:
   
  Most of the families implemented in the `glm()` function are also implemented 
  in the `glmb()` function (the `lmb()` function covers only gaussian() families). 
  Link functions that lead to log-concave likelihood functions are generally 
  implemented.  Specifically, we have the following:
  
  **Supported likelihoods:** gaussian (identity), Poisson / quasi-Poisson
  (log), binomial / quasi-binomial (logit, probit, cloglog), Gamma (log).

### Prior Family functions:

 `pfamily` constructors are used to specify priors and play the same
  kind of role for the prior specifications as `family` constructors 
  and `link` functions play for the likelihoods. Specifically, we
  have the following:

  **Supported Priors:** Normal (all families/links), Normal–Gamma and 
  independent Normal–Gamma (gaussian families), and Gamma-on-precision 
  (gaussian and Gamma families).
  
### Prior_Setup function:
 
  The package comes with a convenient `Prior_Setup()` function that provides 
  default prior input parameters for each of the implemented models. Basic calls
  (without tailoring) mirror traditional calls to the `glmb()` and `lmb()`
  functions respectively and only require the user to provide the model formula
  and (if not the gaussian family) the family/link function. 
  
  The function can also be used to easily adjust prior specifications 
  (see documentation for details).
  
### Extensive Method functions:
  
  The package comes with extensive method functions that mirror those 
  for the classical functions.  These include dedicated `print()`,
  `summary()`, `predict()` and `simulate()` functions.

### Lower Level Modeling functions:

  The package comes with lower level modeling/simulation functions
  that advanced users can use to implement block Gibbs samplers. These
  generally come with less overhead than the `glmb()` and `lmb()` functions 
  and are called internally by the the higher level modeling functions.

### RcppParallel and OpenCL GPU Acceleration Implementations
  
  Some of the simulation functions comes with use_parallel and use_opencl options
  that speed up simulation for higher dimensional models.
  
### Extensive help files, vignettes, examples and demos

  The package also comes with extensive help files for the varios functions 
  that are complemented with a rich set of vignettes. A large number of 
  examples and demos are also availabel (see the READM.md file for a sample).
