# CRAN submission comments — glmbayes 0.9.0

## Package summary

glmbayes provides iid sampling for Bayesian Generalized Linear Models
(Gaussian, Poisson, Binomial, Gamma) via accept-reject methods based on
likelihood subgradients (Nygren & Nygren, 2006). It mirrors the interface
of base R's glm() and lm(), and optionally accelerates envelope
construction via OpenCL for high-dimensional models. OpenCL is an optional
capability; the package detects its absence at build time and disables that
code path gracefully — all checks pass on platforms without OpenCL. See 
README.md and NEWS.md for additional package details.

A version of package prior to a change to the Rcpp Include/Suggest setup ran as below

- R-devel   
    - R Under development (unstable) (2026-04-25 r89962 ucrt)
    - Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32 (Windows Server 2022 x64)
    - Toolchain: GCC 14.3.0 (C/C++) and GNU Fortran 14.3.0
    - Rcpp 1.1.1-1.1
    - 0 errors, 0 warnings, 3 notes (New submission)
    where the additional notes were
    a) Package listed in more than one of Depends, Imports, Suggests, Enhances
    b) Skipping checking math rendering: package 'V8' unavailable
    A rerun after removing these currently runs into an ERROR: failed to lock directory
    'd:/RCompile/CRANguest/R-devel/lib' for modifying
    (likely due to re-run being too close to the previous one).

### Mac-builder

- macOS release (mac.R-project.org)
    - Build system: `r-release-macosx-arm64|4.6.0|macosx|macOS 26.2 (25C56)|Mac mini|Apple M1||en_US.UTF-8|macOS 14.4|clang-1700.6.3.2|GNU Fortran (GCC) 14.2.0`
    - R Under development (unstable) (2026-03-22 r89674)
    - Platform: aarch64-apple-darwin23
    - Toolchain: Apple clang 17.0.0 (clang-1700.6.3.2), GNU Fortran (GCC) 14.2.0
    - Rcpp 1.1.1-1.1 
    - Status: OK (macbuilder reports final status instead of standard E/W/N summary)

- macOS devel (mac.R-project.org)
    - Build system: `r-release-macosx-arm64|4.6.0|macosx|macOS 26.2 (25C56)|Mac mini|Apple M1||en_US.UTF-8|macOS 14.4|clang-1700.6.3.2|GNU Fortran (GCC) 14.2.0`
    - R Under development (unstable) (2026-03-22 r89674)
    - Platform: aarch64-apple-darwin23
    - Toolchain: Apple clang 17.0.0 (clang-1700.6.3.2), GNU Fortran (GCC) 14.2.0
    - Rcpp 1.1.1-1.1
    - Status: OK (macbuilder reports final status instead of standard E/W/N summary)

Both macOS release and devel submissions currently report the same effective build profile
on arm64 and now finish with `Status: OK`.

### R-universe
- R-universe: all non-wasm platforms pass with 0 errors, 0 warnings, and 0 notes.
- wasm (WebAssembly) remains expected to fail because the package includes compiled
  C/C++ code that is not compatible with the wasm toolchain.

### rhub (via rhub::rhub_check())

**Platforms with regular checks:**

`*` Platforms where R/Rcpp version inconsistencies prevent installation of 
Rcpp 1.1.1-1 or later. Rcpp 1.1.1 installs correctly on these platforms if custom installed. 
The boundary appears to be r89746 (i.e., R 4.6.0 below r89746 requires Rcpp 1.1.1 
instead of Rcpp 1.1.1-1 or later). If the R versions on these systems get updated to the 
release version or later, these should migrate to the latest CRAN Rcpp version.

**Platforms with special checks:**

| Platform    | R version (svn)   | Rcpp version | E/W/N        |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| clang-asan  | R 4.7.0 (r89961)  | 1.1.1-1.1    | 1 NOTE       |
| clang-ubsan | R 4.7.0 (r89961)  | 1.1.1-1.1    | 1 NOTE       |
| gcc-asan    | R 4.7.0 (r89961)  | 1.1.1-1.1    | OK           |
| valgrind    | R 4.7.0 (r89961)  | 1.1.1-1.1    | OK           |

- Remaining NOTE on some clang-based rhub platforms is environment/toolchain-provided:
  non-portable compile flag `-Wp,-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3` reported by `R CMD check`.
  This flag is injected by the build image, not by glmbayes Makevars.

- Sanitizer/valgrind diagnostic summary for special-check platforms:
  - `clang-asan` and `gcc-asan` focus on memory safety (out-of-bounds access, use-after-free,
    double/invalid free); no sanitizer findings attributable to package code were reported.
  - `clang-ubsan` focuses on undefined behavior (e.g., invalid shifts/casts, misalignment,
    overflow-related UB); no UBSAN findings attributable to package code were reported.
  - `valgrind` focuses on runtime memory errors/leaks; no invalid read/write or leak diagnostics
    attributable to package code were reported.
  - These diagnostics apply to code paths exercised during the rhub check workload
    (examples/tests/vignettes run on those platforms).

- rchk: [describe outcome and explain here]


## Comments Related to Notes appearing on various systems

All checks produced 0 errors and 0 warnings. The following 3 notes were
observed on select systems.

### Note: **New submission** 

       Maintainer: 'Kjell Nygren <kjell.a.nygren@gmail.com>'
       New submission

   Expected for an initial CRAN submission. No action required.

### Note: **Non-OpenCL Examples with long CPU or elapsed time**

       Examples with CPU (user + system) or elapsed time > 5s
                user  system elapsed
       rlmb    12.60    0.45   10.61

This appears only on select platforms. Iteration counts in this example have been
reduced for CRAN compliance (n_burnin = 200, n_samples = 200, n = 1000). The example
compares a two-block Gibbs sampler (MCMC) to the main lmb implementation (MC).

### Note on rchk
[rchk checks for PROTECT issues in C code. Describe what rchk flagged,
whether it is a false positive, and what you did to investigate or
mitigate it. If the flag is in Rcpp-generated code rather than your
own C, say so explicitly.]

### Note: **OpenCL Examples with long CPU or elapsed time**

       Examples with CPU (user + system) or elapsed time > 5s
                        user  system elapsed
       Boston_centered 150.89  16.16  105.20
       Cleveland        42.25   3.00   29.34

`Boston_centered` and `Cleveland` are GPU/OpenCL examples wrapped in `\donttest{}`
for CRAN compliance. The heavy path runs only when `has_opencl()` is true and is
excluded from routine `R CMD check` example testing. The timings above are from an
OpenCL-capable maintainer machine and are included to document behavior and
performance validation. 

**Timing columns:** `elapsed` is wall-clock time (what CRAN’s example-timing checks care about).
`user` and `system` are CPU time for the R process; on parallel workloads (host threads,
OpenMP/BLAS, OpenCL/device overlap), CPU time can be summed across cores so **user + system
can exceed elapsed** even though wall-clock time is lower.

**Why this matters for users:** The main motivation for the OpenCL path is speed on **large**
problems (many covariates and/or observations). **Wall-clock gains from parallel GPU/OpenCL
execution typically grow with problem size**—often dramatically—because work maps well to the
device and amortizes setup. The examples above use **modest** data sizes so they stay
runnable in documentation; they **understate** the speedup you should expect on realistically
large models, where the advantage over a serial CPU-only path is likely to be **much**
larger.
